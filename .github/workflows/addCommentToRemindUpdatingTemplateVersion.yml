        I see that you changed templates under the detections/analytic rules folder. Did you remember to update the version of the templates you changed?
        If not, and if you want customers to be aware that a new version of this template is available, please update the ``version`` property of the template you changed.
      prNumber: "${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
