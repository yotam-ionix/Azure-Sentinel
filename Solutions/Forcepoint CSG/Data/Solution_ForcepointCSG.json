  "Description": "[Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/cloud-security-gateway) (CSG) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel exports web and/or email logs so that custom dashboards can be created using Workbooks to visualize events and insights on activities of Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway.\n\nFor more details about this solution refer to [integration documentation](https://forcepoint.github.io/docs/csg_and_sentinel/).\n\r\n1. **Forcepoint CSG via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Forcepoint CSG logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Forcepoint CSG via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Forcepoint CSG logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Forcepoint CSG via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
